title: Mermaid
---

import { Mermaid } from "@interledger/docs-design-system";

Due to various CI pipeline issues with the [remark-mermaidjs](https://github.com/remcohaszing/remark-mermaidjs), we have decided to create our own Mermaid component that [calls the Mermaid Javascript API](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/getting-started.html#_3-calling-the-javascript-api) directly.

Use this component if you wish to render a diagram written in Mermaid on the docs pages. You can refer to the [Mermaid documentation](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/syntax-reference.html) for diagram syntax. This component takes in the mermaid diagram syntax as a template literal through the `graph` attribute.

To use it, your docs page must be in `.mdx` format. Please change the format from `.md` to `.mdx` if necessary. All your existing markdown will still be supported without issue.

## Usage

Import the `MermaidWrapper` component like so:

```jsx
import { Mermaid } from "@interledger/docs-design-system";
```

Use the `<Mermaid>` component within your content like so:

```jsx
<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    loop Healthcheck
    John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
    end
    Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    John->>Bob: How about you?
    Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
`}
/>
```

## Working example

<Mermaid
  graph={`sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    loop Healthcheck
    John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
    end
    Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    John->>Bob: How about you?
    Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
  `}
/>
