title: LinkOut

import { LinkOut } from '@interledger/docs-design-system'

This component forces external links to open in a new tab, overriding the default Starlight behavior.

:::danger
Do not use this component at the beginning of a line. Doing so can (but not always) cause GitHub checks to fail. See [below](#at-the-beginning-of-a-line) for more information.
:::

The component adds the necessary attributes for external links and an indicator icon to the end of the linked content. The icon can be turned off, if necessary.

To use the component, the page must be in `.mdx` format. Change the format from `.md` to `.mdx` if necessary. All your existing markdown will still be supported without issue.

## Usage

### General usage

Import the `LinkOut` component like so:

```jsx
import { LinkOut } from '@interledger/docs-design-system'
```

Use the `<LinkOut>` component within your content like so:

```jsx
<LinkOut href="https://openpayments.dev/">OpenPayments API</LinkOut>
```

To disable the indicator icon, set the `withIcon` prop to `false`.

```jsx
<LinkOut href="https://openpayments.dev/" withIcon={false}>
  OpenPayments API
</LinkOut>
```

### At the beginning of a line

In some cases, using this component at the beginning of a line can cause GitHub checks to fail.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html title="Component at beginning of line" wrap
<LinkOut href="https://openpayments.dev/">Open Payments</LinkOut> is an open RESTful API and an API standard that enables clients to interface with Open Payments-enabled accounts...
```

One way around this issue is to add `{/* prettier-ignore */}` above the line. However, we decided as a team that we don't want to take this approach as it's a bit messy and not a great practice.

As such, we've chosen to circumvent the issue by never starting a line with this component in any project. Instead, work the component into the beginning sentence. All it takes is a single word before the component to prevent failed checks.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```html title="Component within a line" wrap
The <LinkOut href="https://openpayments.dev/">Open Payments</LinkOut> APIs are open RESTful APIs that enable clients to interface with Open Payments-enabled accounts.
```
