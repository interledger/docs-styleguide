import { LargeImg } from '@interledger/docs-design-system'

If you're working with an image or diagram that is larger than our available content area, use this component to allow users to view the full image/diagram in a new tab.

The component adds a link to "View full image" with an external link indicator under the bottom-right corner of the image. It takes in a `src` and `alt`, just like a normal `img` element.

To use the component, the page must be in `.mdx` format. Change the format from `.md` to `.mdx` if necessary. All your existing markdown will still be supported without issue.

## Usage

Import the `LargeImg` component like so:

```jsx
import { LargeImg } from '@interledger/docs-design-system'
```

Use the `<LargeImg>` component within your content like so:

```jsx
<LargeImg src="/img/OMG_A_GIGANTIC_IMG.png" alt="A really large diagram" />
```

By default, there will be a border around the image. To remove the border, pass in a `hasBorder={false}` attribute.

```jsx
<LargeImg
  src="/img/OMG_A_GIGANTIC_IMG.png"
  alt="A really large diagram"
  hasBorder={false}
/>
```

For user doc diagrams, be sure to include the `docs` folder in the path.

```jsx
<LargeImg src="/img/docs/OMG_A_GIGANTIC_IMG.png" alt="A really large diagram" />
```

## Working example

<LargeImg
  src="/img/diagram-wm-overview.png"
  alt="Overview diagram of Web Monetization"
/>
