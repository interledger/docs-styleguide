import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

:::note[April 30, 2024]
This component is only implemented in Melissa's local Web Monetization branch. If you need it added to another doc set, let HJ know. 
:::

This component allows you to hide the *Overview* heading from a page's table of contents.

## Usage

Open the `PageSidebar.astro` file.

<FileTree>
- src
    - components
        - docs
            - **PageSidebar.astro**
</FileTree>

Enter the path to the offending page in the `removeOverview` section like so:

```js
const removeOverview = [
    'docs/resources/glossary',
    'docs/payments/send-receive',
```
