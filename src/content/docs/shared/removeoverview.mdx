title: RemoveOverview

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

This component allows you to hide the _Overview_ heading from a page's table of contents.

## Usage

Open the `PageSidebar.astro` file.

:::note
This component is added on a per-site basis. It's not technically a shared component that's part of `@interledger/docs-design-system`.

If you can't find `PageSidebar.astro`, it may not have been added to the site yet. Just let Sarah know.
:::

<FileTree>- src - components - docs - **PageSidebar.astro**</FileTree>

Enter the path to the offending page in the `removeOverview` section like so:

```js
const removeOverview = [
    'docs/resources/glossary',
    'docs/payments/send-receive',
```
