import { Tooltip } from "@interledger/docs-design-system";

This component allows you add a small, stylized question mark element that, when hovered over, displays a text box. 

:::note[Considerations]
* Tooltip text should be short. If the text becomes too long, consider linking to a page or glossary term instead.
* Longer tooltips that appear near the top of the page might be cut off by the UI.
:::

The component is built to be accessible in accordance to the guidance from [WAI Tooltip Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tooltip/). 

To use the component, the page must be in `.mdx` format. Change the format from `.md` to `.mdx` if necessary. All your existing markdown will still be supported without issue.

## Usage

Import the `Tooltip` component like so:

```jsx
import { Tooltip } from "@interledger/docs-design-system";
```

The component can be used within your content in a few ways. Technically, you can add the following in the location you want the question mark element to appear:

```jsx
<Tooltip content="This appears on hover"></Tooltip>
```

However, a better practice is to wrap the word or phrase that the tooltip pertains to.

In the following example, the question mark element will appear after the word _this_.

```jsx
Define <Tooltip content="Hint text">this</Tooltip> term.
```

In this next example, the question mark element will appear between the word _to_ and the ending punctuation.

```jsx title="Example 2"
<Tooltip content="This appears on hover">
  <a href="/URL">This is the content</a> that the tooltip relates to 
</Tooltip>.
```

## Working examples

This is a sentence that has many technical terms. A <Tooltip content="Concise and clear explanation here">tooltip</Tooltip> could help with explaining a term when hovered over. Don't make them too long though.

This example contains a tooltip along with a link to see <Tooltip content='Bubees is not a typo. Bubees is a cat.'><a href="http://www.autofish.net/mirrors/images/animals/cats/bubees.jpg">Bubees</a></Tooltip>.
