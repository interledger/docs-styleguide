title: Tooltip

import { Tooltip } from "@interledger/docs-design-system";

Use the Tooltip component for adding a short explanation to specific terms. This component is built to be accessible in accordance to the guidance from [WAI Tooltip Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tooltip/). Note that the `client:load` attribute is required for the functionality to work because this component uses Javascript for interactivity.

To use it, your docs page must be in `.mdx` format. Please change the format from `.md` to `.mdx` if necessary. All your existing markdown will still be supported without issue.

:::note
Using apostrophes in a tooltip will throw an error.

## Usage

Import the `Tooltip` component like so:

```jsx
import { Tooltip } from "@interledger/docs-design-system";
```

Use the `<Tooltip>` component within your content like so:

```jsx
<Tooltip
  content="Content to display in the tooltip upon interaction"
  client:load
>
  <span>Text that you are trying to explain.</span>
</Tooltip>
```

To link a word or phrase that has an associated tooltip, add the link within the `<Tooltip>` like so:

```jsx
<Tooltip
  content="Content to display in the tooltip upon interaction"
  client:load
>
  <a href="/URL">Text that you are trying to explain</a>
</Tooltip>
```

## Working examples

### Simple tooltip

This is a sentence that has many technical terms. A <Tooltip content="Concise and clear explanation here" client:load>tooltip</Tooltip> could help with explaining a term when hovered over. Don't make them too long though.

### Tooltip and link

This example contains a tooltip along with a link to see <Tooltip content='Bubees is not a typo. Bubees is a cat.' client:load><a href="http://www.autofish.net/mirrors/images/animals/cats/bubees.jpg">Bubees</a></Tooltip>.
