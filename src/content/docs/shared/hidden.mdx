import { Hidden } from '@interledger/docs-design-system'

This component hides content by adding a `display:none` to the wrapped content.

**It's not meant for long-term use**.

:::note
The hidden content is visible when viewing the page source.
:::

## Usage

Import the Hidden component like so:

```jsx
import { Hidden } from '@interledger/docs-design-system'
```

Use the `Hidden` component within your content like so:

```jsx
This is respectable content that should be read by everyone.

<Hidden>This is not ready to be shown.</Hidden>

This is fine to show too.
```

Due to how page-level TOCs are generated, hiding a heading requires us to either comment it out or delete it.

## Working example

Trust me, there's a line that isn't visible. View the page source.

<Hidden>This is not ready to be shown.</Hidden>

This is fine to show.
