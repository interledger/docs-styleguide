title: image max-width
---

Use the `max-width` style to set the maximum width of an image. This is especially helpful for unnecessarily large screenshots.

In the example below, `600px` is used as an example. Adjust the amount as needed.

```html
<img
  src="/img/diagram-wm-overview.png"
  alt="Overview diagram of Web Monetization"
  style="max-width:600px"
/>
```

## Working example

<img
  src="/img/diagram-wm-overview.png"
  alt="Overview diagram of Web Monetization"
  style="max-width:600px"
/>
