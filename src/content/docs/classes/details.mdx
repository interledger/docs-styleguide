title: details
---

The `<details>` disclosure element is an HTML element that creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an open state. A `summary` or label must be provided using the `<summary>` element. - [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details)

:::note
We also have an in-house [Disclosure component](/shared/disclosure), but we decided in October 2024 to move away from using it. We may deprecate the component completely in the future.
:::

You can nest any other Markdown syntax inside a `<details>` element. Some, if not all, of Starlight's components can also be nested. For example, you can use an aside within the element.

## Example usage
