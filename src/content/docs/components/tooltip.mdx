import { Tooltip } from "@interledger/docs-design-system";

Use the tooltip component for adding a short explanation to specific terms. This component is built to be accessible in accordance to the guidance from [WAI Tooltip Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tooltip/). Note that the `client:load` attribute is required for the functionality to work because this component uses Javascript for interactivity.

To use it, your docs page must be in `.mdx` format. Please change the format from `.md` to `.mdx` if necessary. All your existing markdown will still be supported without issue.

## Usage

Import the `Tooltip` component like so:

```jsx
import { Tooltip } from "@interledger/docs-design-system";
```

Use the `<Tooltip>` component within your content like so:

```jsx
<Tooltip content='THIS CONTENT IS DISPLAYED IN THE TOOLTIP UPON INTERACTION' client:load><span>text that you are trying to explain</span></Tooltip>.
```

If the text you are trying to explain is also a link to somewhere else, please put the link within the `<Tooltip>` like so:

```jsx
<Tooltip content='THIS CONTENT IS DISPLAYED IN THE TOOLTIP UPON INTERACTION' client:load><a href="/URL">text that you are trying to explain</a></Tooltip>.
```

## Working example

This is a sentence that has many technical terms, a <Tooltip content="Consise and clear explanation here" client:load>tooltip</Tooltip> could help with explaining them when users hover over the term. Don't make them too long though.
