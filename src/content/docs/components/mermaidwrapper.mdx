title: MermaidWrapper
---

import { MermaidWrapper } from "@interledger/docs-design-system";

Use this component if your Mermaid diagram is much larger than our available space and you would like users to view the full diagram in another tab. This adds "View full diagram" button with an external link indicator on the bottom right corner under the diagram. Note that the `client:load` attribute is required for the functionality to work because this component relies on state.

To use it, your docs page must be in `.mdx` format. Please change the format from `.md` to `.mdx` if necessary. All your existing markdown will still be supported without issue.

## Usage

Import the `MermaidWrapper` component like so:

```jsx
import { MermaidWrapper } from "@interledger/docs-design-system";
```

Use the `<MermaidWrapper>` component within your content like so:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
````jsx
<MermaidWrapper client:load>
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
   Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
   John-->>Alice: Great!
   Alice-)John: See you later!
```
</MermaidWrapper>
````

By default, there will be a border around the image, but if you want to remove the border, pass in a `hasBorder={false}` attribute.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
````jsx
<MermaidWrapper client:load hasBorder={false}>
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
   Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
   loop Healthcheck
      John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
   end
   Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
   John-->>Alice: Great!
   John->>Bob: How about you?
   Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
```
</MermaidWrapper>
````

If you happen to be using some sort of format on save functionality in your code editor, like Prettier, it might sometimes screw up your formatting. You might want to ask Prettier to ignore your Mermaid block just in case.

```
{/* prettier-ignore */}
```

## Working example

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<MermaidWrapper client:load>
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
   Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
   loop Healthcheck
   John->>John: Fight against hypochondria
   end
   Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
   John-->>Alice: Great!
   John->>Bob: How about you?
   Bob-->>John: Jolly good!
```
</MermaidWrapper>
