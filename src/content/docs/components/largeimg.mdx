import { LargeImg } from "@interledger/docs-design-system";

Use this component if you have a diagram or image that is much larger than our available space and you would like users to view the full image in another tab. This adds a link to "View full image" with an external link indicator on the bottom right corner under the image. It takes in a `src` and `alt`, just like a normal `img` element.

To use it, your docs page must be in `.mdx` format. Please change the format from `.md` to `.mdx` if necessary. All your existing markdown will still be supported without issue.

## Usage

Import the `LargeImg` component like so:

```jsx
import { LargeImg } from "@interledger/docs-design-system";
```

Use the `<LargeImg>` component within your content like so:

```jsx
<LargeImg src="/img/OMG_A_GIGANTIC_IMG.png" alt="A really large diagram" />
```

By default, there will be a border around the image, but if you want to remove the border, pass in a `hasBorder={false}` attribute.

```jsx
<LargeImg
  src="/img/OMG_A_GIGANTIC_IMG.png"
  alt="A really large diagram"
  hasBorder={false}
/>
```

For user doc diagrams, be sure to include the `docs` folder in the path.

```jsx
<LargeImg src="/img/docs/OMG_A_GIGANTIC_IMG.png" alt="A really large diagram" />
```

## Working example

<LargeImg
  src="/img/diagram-wm-overview.png"
  alt="Overview diagram of Web Monetization"
/>
