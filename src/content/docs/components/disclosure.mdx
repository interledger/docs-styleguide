title: Disclosure

import { Disclosure } from "@interledger/docs-design-system";
import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Use this component if you have some content that you want to show/hide via a collapsible container. This component wraps around whatever content you wish to have this expand/collapse behaviour. Note that the `client:load` attribute is required for the functionality to work because this component relies on state.

To use it, your docs page must be in `.mdx` format. Please change the format from `.md` to `.mdx` if necessary. All your existing markdown will still be supported without issue.

## Usage

Import the `Disclosure` component like so:

```jsx
import { Disclosure } from "@interledger/docs-design-system";
```

Use the `<Disclosure>` component within your content like so:

```jsx
<Disclosure toggleText='Show code snippets' client:load>
   <!-- Your content, can be markup or markdown -->
</Disclosure>
```

For the specific use-case of displaying multiple code-snippets, it might be worth considering also using the [built-in Starlight `<Tabs>`](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components#tabs) component:

````jsx
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<Disclosure toggleText='Show code snippets' client:load>
   <Tabs>
      <TabItem label='Request'>
      ```bash
      GET /alice HTTP/1.1
      Accept: application/json
      Host: wallet.example
      ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label='Response'>
      ```bash
      HTTP/1.1 200 Success
      Content-Type: application/json

      {
         "id":"https://wallet.example/alice",
         "assetCode":"USD",
         "assetScale":2,
         "authServer":"https://wallet.example/auth",
      }
      ```
      </TabItem>

   </Tabs>
</Disclosure>
````

## Working examples

<Disclosure toggleText="Show hidden text" client:load>
  Just some text that does not need to be seen on first load
</Disclosure>

<Disclosure toggleText='Show code snippets' client:load>
   <Tabs>
      <TabItem label='Request'>
      ```bash
      GET /alice HTTP/1.1
      Accept: application/json
      Host: wallet.example
      ```
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label='Response'>
      ```bash
      HTTP/1.1 200 Success
      Content-Type: application/json

      {
         "id":"https://wallet.example/alice",
         "assetCode":"USD",
         "assetScale":2,
         "authServer":"https://wallet.example/auth",
      }
      ```
      </TabItem>

   </Tabs>
</Disclosure>
