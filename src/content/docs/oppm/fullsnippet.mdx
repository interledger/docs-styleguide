:::caution
This component only exists in the [Open Payments repository](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments/tree/main/docs/src/components). Please raise [an issue](https://github.com/interledger/docs-design-system/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.yml&title=%5BFEATURE%5D+%3Ctitle%3E) if you feel it should be elevated into the shared library.
:::

This component allows you to pull an entire file from a public Github repository to be displayed as code within a page.

It takes a `source` attribute which must be from the `raw.githubsercontent.com` API.

To use the component, the page must be in `.mdx` format. Change the format from `.md` to `.mdx` if necessary. All your existing markdown will still be supported without issue.

## Usage

Import the `FullSnippet` component like so:

```jsx
import FullSnippet from "/src/components/FullSnippet.astro";
```

Use the `<FullSnippet>` component within your content like so:

```
<FullSnippet source='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interledger/open-payments-snippets/main/incoming-payment/incoming-payment-create.ts' />
```

## Working example

There's no working example at the moment.

This component was created to pull in GitHub files before the [ChunkedSnippet](/oppm/chunkedsnippet) component existed. ChunkedSnippet negated the need for us to use this component for our particular use case; however, it still exists and can be used as needed.
