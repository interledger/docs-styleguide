:::caution
This component only exists in the [Open Payments repository](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments/tree/main/docs/src/components). Please raise [an issue](https://github.com/interledger/docs-design-system/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.yml&title=%5BFEATURE%5D+%3Ctitle%3E) if you feel it should be elevated into the shared library
:::

Use this component if you wish pull an entire file from a public Github repository to be displayed as code. It takes a `source` attribute which must be from the `raw.githubsercontent.com` API. To use it, your docs page must be in `.mdx` format. Please change the format from `.md` to `.mdx` if necessary. All your existing markdown will still be supported without issue.

## Usage

Import the `FullSnippet` component like so:

```jsx
import FullSnippet from "/src/components/FullSnippet.astro";
```

Use the `<FullSnippet>` component within your content like so:

```
<FullSnippet source='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interledger/open-payments-snippets/main/incoming-payment/incoming-payment-create.ts' />
```
