:::caution
This component only exists in the [Open Payments repository](https://github.com/interledger/open-payments/tree/main/docs/src/components). Raise [an issue](https://github.com/interledger/docs-design-system/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.yml&title=%5BFEATURE%5D+%3Ctitle%3E) if you feel it should be elevated into the shared library.
:::

This component allows you to display specially formatted code snippet files from a public GitHub repo within a page. 

The snippet files must have "chunking comments" for the component to work correctly. [Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interledger/open-payments-snippets/main/wallet-address/wallet-address-get.ts).

The component takes a `source` attribute which must be a **raw Github link**, and a `chunk` attribute which specifies the chunk you want to display on-page.

To use the component, the page must be in `.mdx` format. Change the format from `.md` to `.mdx` if necessary. All your existing markdown will still be supported without issue.

## Usage

Import the `ChunkedSnippet` component like so:

```jsx
import ChunkedSnippet from "/src/components/ChunkedSnippet.astro";
```

Use the `<ChunkedSnippet>` component within your content like so:

```
<ChunkedSnippet
  source='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huijing/filerepo/gh-pages/incoming-grant.ts'
  chunk='1'
/>
```

## Working example

Refer to the TypeScript code snippets within the Open Payments documentation for [Get wallet address information](https://openpayments.guide/snippets/wallet-get-info/#prerequisites). The raw source file is located [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interledger/open-payments-snippets/main/wallet-address/wallet-address-get.ts).
