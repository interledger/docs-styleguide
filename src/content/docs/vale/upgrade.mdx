title: Upgrade Vale
---

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

As of December 2025, we're using Vale v3.13.

1. Using CLI, check Vale's version. Try `vale -v` and if that doesn't work, try `vale -version`.

2. Reinstall Vale. _It might not matter where you run the command from_, but if you want, you can go into `.../docs-styleguide/vale` in CLI.
   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="Mac">```shell $ brew reinstall vale ```</TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Windows">
       ```shell > choco uninstall vale > choco install vale ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Linux">
       ```shell $ snap remove vale $ snap install vale ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>
3. Using CLI, go into `.../docs-styleguide/vale` if you aren't there already. Run:
   ```shell
   vale sync
   ```
4. Check that the version number is updated.
5. Get latest from the `docs-styleguide` project. This step isn't required to perform the upgrade but is a best practice.
