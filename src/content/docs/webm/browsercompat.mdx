:::caution
This component only exists in the [Web Monetization repository](https://github.com/WICG/webmonetization/tree/main/src/components/docs). Raise [an issue](https://github.com/interledger/docs-design-system/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.yml&title=%5BFEATURE%5D+%3Ctitle%3E) if you feel it should be elevated into the shared library.

This component generates a compatibility table based on the browser compatibility data passed into it. The key is to pass the component the correct data.

All of our browser compatibility data files can be found in `/src/data/browser-compat-data` within the Web Monetization repo.

To use the component, the page must be in `.mdx` format. Change the format from `.md` to `.mdx` if necessary. All your existing markdown will still be supported without issue.

## Usage

Import the component and the relevant data file like so:

```jsx
import BrowserCompat from '/src/components/docs/BrowserCompat.astro'
import data from '/src/data/browser-compat-data/onmonetization.json' /* this is the key */
```

Use the `<BrowserCompat>` component in your page and under a "Browser compatibility" heading like so:

```jsx
## Browser compatibility

<BrowserCompat json={data} />
```

## Working example

A visible example of this component is not available yet. Since we don't have a working Web Monetization extension, there's no need to display a browser compatibility table in the documentation.
