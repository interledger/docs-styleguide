:::caution
This component only exists in the [Web Monetization repository](https://github.com/WICG/webmonetization/tree/main/src/components/docs). Raise [an issue](https://github.com/interledger/docs-design-system/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.yml&title=%5BFEATURE%5D+%3Ctitle%3E) if you feel it should be elevated into the shared library.
:::

This component displays a link to the relevant section of the [Web Monetization specification](https://webmonetization.org/specification/) within a table.

To use the component, the page must be in `.mdx` format. Change the format from `.md` to `.mdx` if necessary. All your existing markdown will still be supported without issue.

## Usage

Import the `Specification` component like so:

```jsx
import Specification from '/src/components/docs/Specification.astro'
```

Use the `<Specification>` component on your page and under a "Specifications" heading like so:

```mdx
## Specifications

<Specification anchor="link-type-monetization" />
```

The `anchor` prop, while optional, allows you to specify the particular section of the spec that's relevant to the page you're working on. If no `anchor` prop is provided, the link will default to the specification itself.

## Working example
