:::caution
This component only exists in the [Web Monetization repository](https://github.com/WICG/webmonetization/tree/main/src/components/docs). Please raise [an issue](https://github.com/interledger/docs-design-system/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.yml&title=%5BFEATURE%5D+%3Ctitle%3E) if you feel it should be elevated into the shared library
:::

This component will display a link to the relevant section of the [Web Monetization specification] (https://webmonetization.org/specification/) in a table. To use it, your docs page must be in `.mdx` format. Please change the format from `.md` to `.mdx` if necessary. All your existing markdown will still be supported without issue.

## Usage

Import the `Specification` component like so:

```jsx
import Specification from "/src/components/docs/Specification";
```

Use the `<Specification>` component on your docs page where relevant under a "Specifications" heading like so:

```jsx
## Specifications

<Specification anchor='link-type-monetization' />
```

This component takes in an optional `anchor` prop which allows you to specify a particular section of the specification that is relevant to that individual docs page. If no `anchor` prop is provided, it will default to the specification itself.

## Working example
