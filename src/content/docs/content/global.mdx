There are certain styles that we should consistently follow regardless of the doc site we are working on. If you can't find information about a style here, check the site-specific guides linked in the sidenav.

## Rule #1

Break the rules.

Ok, try not to, but the audience's best interest should always come first. Deviations are OK if they help enhance the clarity of the doc.

## Account servicing entity

We're currently treating account servicing entity as an improper/common noun, meaning each letter should be in lowercase. ASE is an approved initialism.

## APIs/API's

- Plural - APIs
- Possessive - API's

## Buttons

For buttons with labels/text strings, bold the text that appears in the button. If you're instructing someone to click the button, don't use the word _on_. For example:

- Click **Revoke public & private key**. ✅
- Click on Revoke public & private key. ❌

For buttons that are icons (for example, arrows), describe what should be clicked and don't use bold. Avoid using the word _on_ unless it helps with clarity. For example:

- Click the arrow to proceed. ✅
- Click on the **arrow** to proceed. ❌

## Capitalization

### Headings, subheadings, and page titles

Use sentence case for headings, subheadings, and page titles unless a word/term is a proper noun or has a specific capitalization (e.g., “amountSent”, not “AmountSent” to represent a property).

### Initialisms

Capitalize each letter in an initialism. For example, ASE for account servicing entity.

### Commas

Add a comma before the conjunction in a list of three or more items. This is known as an Oxford, or serial, comma.

| Do this…                                                                             | Instead of this…                                                                    |

## Content reuse

Consider using MDX transclusion, also called MDX partials, if you're using the same content across multiple page in the same doc project. Transclusion lets you embed MDX documents in other documents. We’ll refer to these embedded documents as partials.

### /src/partials

Place MDX partial files in the `/src/partials` folder. Create the folder if it doesn't exist.

### Partial files

Typically, partials should be used for small chunks of repeating content. If the partial file contains more than a paragraph, there may be a better way to present the information in the doc project.

Note:

- Don't include frontmatter in your partials file (for example, `title`).
- Headings in a partials file **will not** appear in a page’s table of contents.
- Multiple partial files are supported within a single page.

### Embed a partial

First, import the partial file into the page:

```jsx
import NoPay from '/src/partials/glitchNoPay.mdx'
```

Name the partial however you’d like, but without spaces. In the preceding example, the partial's name is `NoPay`.

Using the name you defined, add the partial in the page's content, in the location it should appear:

```mdx
This is a paragraph of text. I want the partial content to appear beneath this paragraph.

<NoPay />
```

That's it!

## Digital wallet vs account

The term _digital wallet_ can be interpreted a number of ways and we want to be as unambiguous as possible. Be aware of the context in which you’re using the term. Think about whether _account_ or _Open Payments-enabled account_ would be more accurate than _digital wallet_.

## Doc file extensions (MD/MDX)

Create new doc files in MDX unless you have a good reason not to.

## Example URLs, including wallet addresses

Use `example.com` and `subdomain.example.com` in example URLs.

- wallet.example.com
- wallet.example.com/alice

## Headings and subheadings

### Best practices

- Keep headings short.
- Avoid headings that ask questions when possible (unless you're crafting an FAQ).
- When using a gerund (verb + -ing) as the first word in a heading, consider whether a verb would be more direct. For example, _Linking to a WM agent_ vs. _Link to a WM agent_.

### Overviews

Starlight automatically sets the first heading on a page to "Overview", even if the markdown file has an H1 or H2 defined.

## Images

### Alt text

Include alt text for images.

## Initialisms

- Capitalize each letter in an initialism.
- Spell out the entire phrase on first use in a page, then include initialism in parentheses.
- In long pages, periodically spell out the entire phrase and include the initialism in parentheses. Long is subjective, use your best judgment.
- If you use an initialism for a term that also appears in the glossary, add the initialism to the glossary term.
- Don't use initialisms for a term that only appears a few times in a page. Few is subjective, use your best judgment.

## Lists

- Lists should typically contain a minimum of three items.
- Use unordered lists (bullets) when item order is unimportant.
- Use ordered (numbered) lists when order is important (for example, item #1 must be completed before item #2).
- Keep each list as parallel as possible. This list isn't a good example.
  - All items start with a noun, or all start with a verb.
  - All items have ending punctuation, or none do.
  - All items start with a capital letter, or all start with lowercase.
- If a list is introduced by a full sentence, end the sentence with the proper punctuation. If introduced with a sentence fragment, end with a colon.

## Please

We're taking [Google's approach](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list#please): Don't use "please" in the normal course of explaining how to use a product, even if you're explaining a difficult task.

## See

Previously, we tried to be more inclusive by staying away from using _see_ when referring to a link (for example, _see XYZ for more information_).

We've decided that it **is** OK to use _see_.

The W3C uses _see_ for link references in their [Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-usability-inclusion/) page. Similarly, Google uses it in their [Write inclusive documentation](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation) page and their [word list](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list#see) indicates its OK to use when referring to links and cross-references.

## SHA (secure hash algorithm)

SHA is a common technical term that doesn't need to be defined before it's first use.

When an a/an article is needed, use **a**.

- A SHA-256 hash of the interaction is sent in the response. ✅
- An SHA-256 has of the interaction is sent in the response. ❌

## Sidebar categories

Starlight doesn't allow a sidebar category, or book, to also be a page. For example, clicking **Shared Component** in this project's sidebar expands/collapses the category without navigating you to a new page.

Since a category can't be a page, ensure the category's name and the pages in the category are titled somewhat differently.

For example:

- Intro to Web Monetization
- References
  - Web Monetization API
  - Monetization events
    - MonetizationEvent

## Sidebar external links

If an external link is required in the sidebar, you can use Astro's [sidebar `attrs` property](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/sidebar/#custom-html-attributes) to open the link in a new tab and also add an indicator icon to show the link is external.

```js
sidebar: [
  {
    label: 'Types of Dinosaurs',
    link: 'https://www.amnh.org/dinosaurs/types-of-dinosaurs',
    attrs: {
      target: '_blank',
      rel: 'noopener noreferrer',
      'data-icon': 'external'
    },
  },
],
```

## Test network

Always spell out test network. Don't abbreviate to testnet.

## Tooltips

The [Tooltip](/shared/tooltip) component allows you to add additional text to a word or phrase. The text appears when you hover your cursor over the <Tooltip content='This is an example tooltip'><span>question mark</span></Tooltip>.

- Tooltips should be short. Consider linking to a page or glossary term instead of using the Tooltip component if a tooltip becomes too long.
- Longer tooltips that appear at the top of the page might be cut off by the UI.
