:::caution
This guide is in progress and won’t be complete until we start digging into the other doc sites.
:::

This guide covers styles that are shared between all doc sites using the Starlight framework.

Styles should apply to all sites whenever possible; however, there could be a need for site-specific styles. If you can’t find what you’re looking for in this guide, check in a site-specific guide.

- [Web Monetization](/content/webmonetization)
- [Rafiki](/content/rafiki) (not started)
- [Open Payments](/content/openpayments)
- Payment Pointers (not started)
- [Interledger](/content/interledger) (not started)

## Rule #1

Break the rules.

Ok, try not to, but the audience’s best interest should always come first. Deviations are OK if they help enhance the clarity of the doc.

## APIs/API's

- Plural - APIs
- Possessive - API's

## Buttons

For buttons with labels/text strings, bold the text that appears in the button. If you're instructing someone to click the button, don't use the word _on_. For example:

- Click **Revoke public & private key**. ✅
- Click on Revoke public & private key. ❌

For buttons that are icons (e.g., arrows), describe what should be clicked and don't use bold. Avoid using the word _on_ unless it helps with clarity. For example:

- Click the arrow to proceed. ✅
- Click on the **arrow** to proceed. ❌

## Capitalization

### Headings, subheadings, and page titles

Use sentence case for headings, subheadings, and page titles unless a word/term is a proper noun or has a specific capitalization (e.g., “amountSent”, not “AmountSent” to represent a property).

### Initialisms

Capitalize each letter in an initialism. For example, WM for Web Monetization.

### Commas

Add a comma before the conjunction in a list of three or more items. This is known as an Oxford, or serial, comma.

| Do this…                                                                             | Instead of this…                                                                    |

## Content reuse

Consider using MDX transclusion, also called MDX partials, if you’re using the same content across multiple page in the same doc project. Transclusion lets you embed MDX documents in other documents. We’ll refer to these embedded documents as partials.

### /src/partials

Place MDX files to embed within the `/src/partials` folder. Create the folder if it doesn’t exist.

### Partial files

Typically, partials should be used for small chunks of repeating content. If the partial file contains more than a paragraph, there may be a better way to present the information within the doc project.

Note:

- Don’t include front matter in your partials file.
- Headings within a partials file do not appear in a page’s table of contents.
- Multiple partial files are supported within a single page.

### Embed a partial file

First, import the partial file into the page:

```jsx
import NoPay from "/src/partials/glitchNoPay.mdx";
```

Name the partial however you’d like, but without spaces. In the example above, the partial's name is `NoPay`.

Using the name you defined, add the partial within the page's content, in the location it should appear:

```mdx
This is a paragraph of text. I want the partial content to appear beneath this paragraph.

<NoPay />
```

## Digital wallet vs account

The term _digital wallet_ can be interpreted a number of ways and we want to be as unambiguous as possible. Be aware of the context in which you’re using the term. Think about whether _account_ or _Open Payments-enabled account_ would be more accurate than _digital wallet_.

## Doc file extensions (MD/MDX)

Create new doc files in MDX unless there’s a need for something else.

## Example URLs, including wallet addresses

Use `example.com` and `subdomain.example.com` in example URLs.

- wallet.example.com
- wallet.example.com/alice

## Headings and subheadings

### Best practices

- Keep headings short.
- Avoid headings that ask questions when possible (unless you're crafting an FAQ).
- When using a gerund (verb + -ing) as the first word in a heading, consider whether a verb would be more direct. For example, _Linking to a WM agent_ vs. _Link to a WM agent_.

### Overviews

Starlight automatically sets the first heading on a page to Overview, even if the markdown file has an H1 or H2 defined.

## Images

### Alt text

Include alt text for images.

## Initialisms

- Capitalize each letter in an initialism.
- Spell out the entire phrase on first use within a page, then include initialism in parentheses.
- In long pages, periodically spell out the entire phrase and include the initialism in parentheses. Long is subjective, use your best judgment.
- If you use an initialism for a term that also appears in the glossary, add the initialism to the glossary term.
- Don’t use initialisms for a term that only appears a few times within a page. Few is subjective, use your best judgment.

## Lists

- Lists should typically contain a minimum of three items.
- Use unordered lists (bullets) when item order is unimportant.
- Use ordered (numbered) lists when order is important (e.g., item #1 must be completed before item #2).
- Keep each list as parallel as possible. This list is not a good example.
  - E.g., all items start with a noun, or all start with a verb.
  - E.g., all items have ending punctuation, or none do.
  - E.g., all items start with a capital letter, or all start with lowercase.
- If a list is introduced by a full sentence, end the sentence with the proper punctuation. If introduced with a sentence fragment, end with a colon.

## See, View [link]

When possible, avoid using the words "see" and "view" when referencing a link. It’s a small thing, but some of our audience might use screen readers. The terms "visit", "review", and "refer to" might be acceptable substitutes.

## Sidebar categories

Starlight does not allow a sidebar category, or book, to also be a page. For example, clicking **Shared Component** in this project's sidebar expands/collapses the category without navigating you to a new page.

Since a category cannot be a page, ensure the category's name and pages within the category are titled somewhat differently.

For example:

- Intro to Web Monetization
- References
  - Web Monetization API
  - Monetization events
    - MonetizationEvent

## Sidebar external links

If an external link is required in the sidebar, you can make use of Astro's [sidebar `attrs` property](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/sidebar/#custom-html-attributes) to open the link in a new tab and also add an indicator icon to show the link is external.

```js
sidebar: [
  {
    label: 'Types of Dinosaurs',
    link: 'https://www.amnh.org/dinosaurs/types-of-dinosaurs',
    attrs: {
      target: '_blank',
      rel: 'noopener noreferrer',
      'data-icon': 'external'
    },
  },
],
```

## Tooltips

The [Tooltip](/shared/tooltip) component allows you to add additional text to a word or phrase. The text appears when you hover your cursor over the <Tooltip content='This is an example tooltip' client:load><span>question mark</span></Tooltip>.

- Tooltips should be short. Consider linking to a page or glossary term instead of using the Tooltip component if a tooltip becomes too long.
- Longer tooltips that appear at the top of the page might be cut off by the UI.
