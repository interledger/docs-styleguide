title: Prettier

Before you commit and publish your changes, run the following command in the doc directory:

```
npx prettier . --write
```

#### Why

> It removes all original styling and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style. - [prettier docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/)

For example, if you're like Melissa and add italics in markdown using single asterisks:

```
I'm making *this part* italic.
```

Prettier automatically converts the asterisk set to underscores:

```
I'm making _this part_ italic.
```
