import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { CodeBlock } from "@interledger/docs-design-system";

## Components
Starlight offers a number of native components that we can use to style pages. The [Components](https://starlight.astro.build/components/using-components/) section in their docs outline how to use each one, though a few we commonly use are listed here.

* [Asides](https://starlight.astro.build/components/asides/)
* [Badges](https://starlight.astro.build/components/badges/)
* [Tabs](https://starlight.astro.build/components/tabs/)

If a component is listed in their doc, but you get an error when trying to use it, we may need to upgrade Starlight.

### Badges

If you use badges to call out a particular REST API method, use the variant that most closely matches what appears for OpenAPIs in Swagger.

* GET - `variant="note"` (blue)
* POST - `variant="success"` (green)
* PUT - `variant="caution"` (yellow)
* DELETE - `variant="danger"` (red)

### Code blocks

Code blocks in Markdown are fenced by three beginning and ending backticks (` ``` `). More information is found [here](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/#code-blocks). Information about how Starlight uses Expressive Code is also provided.

Hovering over a Starlight code block will display a copy button.

#### Syntax highlighting

You can indicate the programming language to use if you want to use syntax highlighting. Astro uses [Shiki](https://shiki.style/languages), so check their documentation if you aren't sure if your language is supported.

#### Block titles and frames

When we first deployed Starlight, it didn't support adding titles to code blocks. This is why we have the in-house [CodeBlock](/shared/codeblock) component.

<CodeBlock title="Example code block with a title">

```
This code block has a title! HJ made the component. Isn't she neat?
```

</CodeBlock>

As of November 2023, Starlight now supports adding titles to code blocks, but the title is styled to appear in a tab. Also, to use the Starlight title, you **must** specify a programming language.

We've chosen to keep our in-house `CodeBlock` component because we like the style more. However, you are free to use the Starlight defaults if they fit better with what you're documenting.

```js title="Starlight default title style"
I mean, at least it works by default now, right?
```

````js
```js title="Starlight default title style"
I mean, at least it works by default now, right?
```
````

By default, a Starlight code block will be rendered as a terminal window if a shell scripting language is used (for example, `bash`, `shell`, `zsh`). Titles are styled differently in this context.

For example:

```bash title="This uses bash"
See what it looks like?
```

See the [Frames and titles](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/#frames-and-titles) section in Starlight's docs for more information.

### Tabs

You can keep multiple tab groups in a page synchronized by using `syncKey`. 

All tabs on a page with the same `syncKey` value will display the same active label. This is especially helpful when documenting programming languages. Note that the synching only persists on the page, not across pages. 

Add an identical `syncKey` property to each `<TabItem>`.

```js {1, 8}
<Tabs syncKey="constellations">
  <TabItem label="Orion">Bellatrix</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Gemini">Pollux</TabItem>
</Tabs>

_Some exoplanets:_

<Tabs syncKey="constellations">
  <TabItem label="Orion">HD 34445 b</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Gemini">Pollux b</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

#### Example

<Tabs syncKey="constellations">
  <TabItem label="Orion">Bellatrix</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Gemini">Pollux</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<hr />

<Tabs syncKey="constellations">
  <TabItem label="Orion">HD 34445 b</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Gemini">Pollux b</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
You can also [add icons](https://starlight.astro.build/components/tabs/#add-icons-to-tabs) to the tabs, but as of June 2025, you're limited to Starlight's [built-in icons](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/icons/#all-icons).

## Misc

### Style a single page with CSS

If there's a style you need to apply to an entire page, to every instance of an element, you can do so in the frontmatter. 

For example, the tables in the [Sequence diagram style guide](/content/sequence-diagrams) were behaving poorly. Text aligned itself to `baseline` which pushed the content in the last row outside the table's bounds. Also, some code that needed to appear on a single line was breaking. 

Instead of adding styles in each table in the page, the styles were applied to the page itself like so:

```
---
title: Sequence diagram style guide
head:
  - tag: style
    content: th, td {vertical-align:top !important; min-width:105px;}
---
```

Starlight can get a little testy when it comes to indentations. If you're getting errors, copy the code block above and update it as needed.
