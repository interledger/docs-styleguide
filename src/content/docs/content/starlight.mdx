import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Starlight has a number of [built-in components](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components/#built-in-components) that are useful for documentation sites.

## Synced tabs

In the future, when our Open Payments SDK has been ported to various languages, we would probably want to show the same feature in different languages and synced tabs might be a good way to present those code snippets.

_Initialize Open Payments client_:

<Tabs syncKey="walletAddress">
  <TabItem label="Javascript">
  ```js
  const client = await createAuthenticatedClient({
    walletAddressUrl: WALLET_ADDRESS,
    privateKey: PRIVATE_KEY_PATH,
    keyId: KEY_ID,
  });
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Ruby">
  ```ruby
  =begin
  I have no idea how the
  Ruby code should look like
  And that is why we do not
  have a Ruby SDK today
  =end
  ```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

_Get wallet address:_

<Tabs syncKey="walletAddress">
  <TabItem label="Javascript">
  ```js
  const walletAddress = await client.walletAddress.get({
    url: WALLET_ADDRESS,
  });
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Ruby">
  ```ruby
  =begin
  I have no idea how the
  Ruby code should look like
  And that is why we do not
  have a Ruby SDK today
  =end
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
