title: Starlight components and misc
---

import { CodeBlock } from "@interledger/docs-design-system";

Starlight offers a number of native components that we can use to style pages. The [Components](https://starlight.astro.build/components/using-components/) section in their docs outline how to use each one, though a few we commonly use are listed here.

* [Asides](https://starlight.astro.build/components/asides/)
* [Badges*](https://starlight.astro.build/components/badges/)
* [Tabs](https://starlight.astro.build/components/tabs/)

If a component is listed in their doc, but you get an error when trying to use it, we may need to upgrade Starlight.

## Badges*

If you use badges to call out a particular REST API method, use the variant that most closely matches what appears for OpenAPIs in Swagger.

* GET - `variant="note"` (blue)
* POST - `variant="success"` (green)
* PUT - `variant="caution"` (yellow)
* DELETE - `variant="danger"` (red)

## Code blocks

Code blocks in Markdown are fenced by three beginning and ending backticks (` ``` `). More information is found [here](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/#code-blocks). Information about how Starlight uses Expressive Code is also provided.

Hovering over a Starlight code block will display a copy button.

:::note
As of November 29, 2023, this button will not appear when using the in-house [ChunkedSnippet](/oppm/chunkedsnippet) component. We're tracking the issue in https://github.com/interledger/open-payments/issues/384.

### Syntax highlighting

You can indicate the programming language to use if you want to use syntax highlighting. Astro uses [Shiki](https://shiki.style/languages), so check their documentation if you aren't sure if your language is supported.

### Block titles and frames

When we first deployed Starlight, it didn't support adding titles to code blocks. This is why we have the in-house [CodeBlock](/shared/codeblock) component.

<CodeBlock title="Example code block with a title">

```
This code block has a title! HJ made the component. Isn't she neat?
```

</CodeBlock>

As of November 2023, Starlight now supports adding titles to code blocks; however, the title is styled to appear in a tab. Also, to use the Starlight title, you **must** specify a programming language.

We've chosen to keep our in-house `CodeBlock` component because we like the style more. However, you are free to use the Starlight defaults if they fit better with what you're documenting.

```js title="Starlight default title style"
I mean, at least it works by default now, right?
```

````js
```js title="Starlight default title style"
I mean, at least it works by default now, right?
```;
````

By default, a Starlight code block will be rendered as a terminal window if a shell scripting language is used (e.g., `bash`, `shell`, `zsh`). Titles are styled differently in this context.

For example:

```bash title="This uses bash"
See what it looks like?
```

See the [Frames and titles](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/#frames-and-titles) section in Starlight's docs for more information.
