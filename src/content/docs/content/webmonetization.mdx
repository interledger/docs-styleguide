## Nouns

### Common nouns

- monetization `<link>` element
- provider
- receiver
- payment pointer
- wallet address

### Proper nouns

- Interledger
- Interledger Protocol (can be abbreviated to ILP after first use on a page)
- Open Payments (always spell out, do not abbreviate as OP)
- Rafiki
- Web Monetization (always spell out, do not abbreviate as WM)

## Account servicing entity

Don't use account servicing entity/ASE in the Web Monetization docs. Use wallet/digital wallet/digital wallet provider.

## Payment pointer vs wallet address

Payment pointer and wallet address are not synonyms. Refer to both when appropriate.

## Spellings

### monetization

We are a US-based 501(c)(3). Use the US spelling of monetization, with a z rather than an s. Z is also used in the URL and the spec. 

### web monetize

If we follow standard US grammar rules, then web monetize and its other forms (e.g., web monetized) should probably be hyphenated.

In the past, I found that the term was used so frequently that the hyphens were visually distracting. I made a style decision to drop the hyphens. We can revisit this decision.

## Web Monetization-specific styles

### Remove overview

The Web Monetization project gives us the ability to hide the Overview heading from a page's table of contents. This is handy on, for example, the Glossary page. 

On Nov. 21, 2024, Melissa requested this functionality be added to all of our doc projects: https://github.com/interledger/docs-design-system/issues/27

All you need to do is add the page that you want the Overview heading removed from to the `removeOverview` portion of `components/docs/PageSidebar.astro`.

```
const removeOverview = [
 'docs/resources/glossary',
]
```

The magic happens because of `components/docs/shared/removeoverview.mdx`, but you don't need to make any changes to this file.
