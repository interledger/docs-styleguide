## Nouns

- receiver
- payment pointer

### Proper nouns

- Interledger, Interledger Protocol
- Open Payments
- Rafiki
- Web Monetization

## Spellings

### monetization

Use the US spelling of monetization, with a z rather than an s. Z is used in the URL and the spec. Plus we need to be consistent within the doc sets.

### web monetize

If we follow standard US grammar rules, then web monetize and its other forms (e.g., web monetized) should probably be hyphenated.

In the past, I found that the term was used so frequently that the hyphens were visually distracting. I made a style decision to drop the hyphens. We can revisit this decision.

## Sessions

There are different types of sessions. Always specify which one.

- payment session (occurs between the WM provider and WM receiver)
- Web Monetization session (browser/page based) [aka monetization session]
