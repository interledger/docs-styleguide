## Spellings

### monetization

Use the US spelling of monetization, with a z rather than an s. Z is used in the URL and the spec. Plus we need to be consistent within the doc sets.

### web monetize

If we follow standard US grammar rules, then web monetize and its other forms (e.g., web monetized) should probably be hyphenated.

In the past, I found that the term was used so frequently that the hyphens were visually distracting. I made a style decision to drop the hyphens. We can revisit this decision.
