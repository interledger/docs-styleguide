## Account servicing entity

Don't use account servicing entity/ASE in the Web Monetization docs. Use wallet.

## Payment pointer vs wallet address

Payment pointer and wallet address are not synonyms. Refer to both when appropriate.

## Spellings

### monetization

We are a US-based 501(c)(3). Use the US spelling of monetization, with a z rather than an s. Z is also used in the URL and the spec. 

### web monetize

If we follow standard US grammar rules, then web monetize and its other forms (e.g., web monetized) should probably be hyphenated.

In the past, I found that the term was used so frequently that the hyphens were visually distracting. I made a style decision to drop the hyphens. We can revisit this decision.
