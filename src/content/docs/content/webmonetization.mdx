## Nouns

### Common nouns

- monetization `<link>` element
- provider
- receiver
- payment pointer
- wallet address

### Proper nouns

- Interledger
- Interledger Protocol (can be abbreviated to ILP after first use on a page)
- Open Payments (always spell out, don't abbreviate as OP)

## Account servicing entity

Don't use account servicing entity/ASE in the Web Monetization docs. Use wallet/digital wallet/digital wallet provider.

## Payment pointer vs wallet address

Payment pointer and wallet address aren't synonyms. Refer to both when appropriate.

## Spellings

### monetization

We're a US-based 501(c)(3). Use the US spelling of monetization, with a z rather than an s. Z is also used in the URL and the spec.

### web monetize

If we follow standard US grammar rules, then web monetize and its other forms (for example, web monetized) should probably be hyphenated.

In the past, I found that the term was used so frequently that the hyphens were visually distracting. I made a style decision to drop the hyphens. We can revisit this decision.
