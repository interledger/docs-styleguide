The majority of content within the documentation projects are written in Markdown. This page touches on some high-level Markdown topics. For more information on Markdown syntax, see:

* https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/
* https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
* https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/

Frontmatter [YAML](https://dev.to/paulasantamaria/introduction-to-yaml-125f) is used to define metadata such as a title and description.

## Frontmatter

A `title` is required frontmatter for most files. One scenario in which a title is **not** required is when the file is a [partial](/content/global#content-reuse). 

Check the full list of [frontmatter configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/frontmatter/) for more fun options.

```

## Images

Images in Starlight use [Astro’s built-in optimized asset support](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/assets/).

We standardise our image location for every project to be in the `/public/img` folder. Start with `/img/` when calling an image.

```md
/// src/content/docs/introduction/architecture.md

![Architecture diagram](/img/rafiki-architecture.png)
```

You may want to further organise the `img` folder with subfolders if the project has a lot of images.

## Headings

Starlight is configured to automatically use your page title as a top-level heading and will include an "Overview" heading at top of each page's table of contents. Starlight does not provide a native way hide "Overview" or change the wording. 

### Automatic heading anchor links

Using headings in Markdown will automatically give you anchor links so you can link directly to certain sections of your page:

Level 2 (`<h2>`) and Level 3 (`<h3>`) headings automatically appear in a page's table of contents. Starlight allows you to [override](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/overrides/#toc) this behavior.

## Advanced Markdown and MDX configuration

Starlight uses Astro’s Markdown and MDX renderer built on remark and rehype. You can add support for custom syntax and behavior by adding `remarkPlugins` or `rehypePlugins` in your Astro config file. See [“Configuring Markdown and MDX”](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#configuring-markdown-and-mdx) in the Astro docs to learn more.

### Mermaid diagrams

:::danger
We no longer support mermaid diagrams using the markdown syntax. Instead, use our custom [`Mermaid` component](/shared/mermaid).
:::

### Mathjax

:::caution
This component requires an extra dependency on [remark-math](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/tree/main) and [rehype-mathjax](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/tree/main/packages/rehype-mathjax) and thus is not enabled by default on all projects. Ping the person responsible for documentation architecture if your project doesn't render mathjax properly.
