Most content in the documentation projects are written in Markdown. This page touches on some high-level Markdown topics. For more information on Markdown syntax, see:

- https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/
- https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
- https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/

Frontmatter [YAML](https://dev.to/paulasantamaria/introduction-to-yaml-125f) is used to define metadata such as a title and description.

## Escape character

Escape a character by adding a backslash before the character.

For example, to show \{client_domain/jwks.json\} in plain text (as shown here), without Starlight giving you an error, you'd need to format it like this:

`\{client_domain/jwks.json}`

## Frontmatter

Most files require a `title` in their frontmatter.

```md
---
title: Remember to set this
---
```

One scenario in which a title is **not** required is when the file is a [partial](/content/global#content-reuse).

Check the full list of [frontmatter configuration](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/frontmatter/) for more fun options.

## Images

Images in Starlight use [Astro’s built-in optimized asset support](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/assets/).

We standardise our image location for every project to be in the `/public/img` folder. Start with `/img/` when calling an image.

```md
/// src/content/docs/introduction/architecture.md

![Architecture diagram](/img/rafiki-architecture.png)
```

You may want to further organise the `img` folder with subfolders if the project has a lot of images.

## Headings

Starlight automatically uses your page title as a top-level heading and includes an "Overview" heading at top of each page's table of contents. Starlight doesn't provide a native way hide "Overview" or change the wording. However, we do have the [RemoveOverview](/shared/removeoverview) component.

### Automatic heading anchor links

Using headings in Markdown will automatically give you anchor links so you can link directly to certain sections of your page:

Level 2 (`<h2>`) and Level 3 (`<h3>`) headings automatically appear in a page's table of contents. Starlight allows you to [override](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/overrides/#toc) this behavior.

## Advanced Markdown and MDX configuration

Starlight uses Astro's Markdown and MDX renderer built on remark and rehype. You can add support for custom syntax and behavior by adding `remarkPlugins` or `rehypePlugins` in your Astro config file. See [“Configuring Markdown and MDX”](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#configuring-markdown-and-mdx) in the Astro docs to learn more.

### Mermaid diagrams

Use our custom [`Mermaid` component](/shared/mermaid) to add Mermaid diagrams to the docs.

### Mathjax

:::caution
This component requires an extra dependency on [remark-math](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/tree/main) and [rehype-mathjax](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/tree/main/packages/rehype-mathjax) and thus isn't enabled by default on all projects. Ping the person responsible for documentation architecture if your project doesn't render mathjax properly.
