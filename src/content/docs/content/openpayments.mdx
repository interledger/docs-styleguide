## Pnpm format

Why do we have to run `pnpm format` before we commit our changes?

<Steps>
1. Because the Open Payments project demands it.
2. It ensures all outputted code conforms to a consistent style.
</Steps>

For example, if you're like Melissa and add italics in markdown using single asterisks:

```
I'm making *this part* italic.
```

Running `pnpm format` automatically converts the asterisk set to underscores:

```
I'm making _this part_ italic.
```
