title: Open Payments style guide
---

## Before you commit and publish changes

Run the following command in the doc directory:

```
npx prettier . --write
```

#### Why

**Reason 1**

It's an Open Payments thing that was put in long ago. Current assumption: It's needed because of the way the specs are integrated with the docs.

**Reason 2**

> It removes all original styling and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style. - [prettier docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/)

For example, if you're like Melissa and add italics in markdown using single asterisks:

```
I'm making *this part* italic.
```

Prettier automatically converts the asterisk set to underscores:

```
I'm making _this part_ italic.
```
