## Prettier notes

Why do we have to run `npx prettier . --write` before we commit our changes?

<Steps>
1. Because the Open Payments project demands it. We think it's because of the way the API specs are integrated with the docs.
2. It ensures all outputted code conforms to a consistent style. - [prettier docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/)
</Steps>

For example, if you're like Melissa and add italics in markdown using single asterisks:

```
I'm making *this part* italic.
```

Prettier automatically converts the asterisk set to underscores:

```
I'm making _this part_ italic.
```
