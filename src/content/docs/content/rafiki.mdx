<Card title="Rafiki Starlight version" icon="star">
Unlike our other doc projects, Rafiki is on an older version of Starlight. 

We can't upgrade because there is an issue with our [astro-graphql-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-graphql-plugin). More details are documented here: https://github.com/interledger/rafiki/issues/1815.
